We start by loading MNPDynamics and define the time interval. Here we use 1000 samples and an excitation frequency of 25 kHz:\n\nusing MNPDynamics\n\n# Time parameters\nfx = 25000;\ntLength = 1000;       # length of time vector\ntMax = 1/fx;          # maximum evaluation time in seconds\nt = range(0, stop=tMax, length=tLength);\n\nIn the next step we define the applied magnetic field. This is done using by defining a  magnetic field function B that maps t to the magnetic flux density B:\n\n# Field parameters\namplitude = 0.012\n\n# Magnetic field for simulation \nB(t) = amplitude*[cos(2*pi*fx*t), 0, 0]\n\nYou can of course also define this as\n\nfunction B(t)\n return amplitude*[cos(2*pi*fx*t), 0, 0]\nend\n\nor as an anonymous function:\n\nB = t -> (amplitude*[cos(2*pi*fx*t), 0, 0])\n\nYou also don't need to call it B.\n\nIn the next step we define additional simulation parameters in a dictionary p and pass B, t and p to the function simulationMNP:\n\n# Parameters\np = Dict{Symbol,Any}()\np[:DCore] = 20e-9                  # particle diameter in nm\np[:relaxation] = NO_RELAXATION     # relaxation mode\n\n# Do simulation\nm = simulationMNP(B, t; p...)\n\nWhat you get back is the mean magnetic moment of the particle. Often we measure this function inductively using a pick-up coil and then receive the time derivative of the mean magnetic moment. The following image shows the result of this simple simulation.\n\n(Image: Simple 1D Simulation)","category":"section"},{"location":"overview.html#Neel-Relaxation","page":"Overview","title":"Neel Relaxation","text":"We next repeat the simulation but change the parameter dictionary like this:\n\np = Dict{Symbol,Any}()\np[:DCore] = 20e-9         # particle diameter in nm\np[:α] = 0.1               # damping coefficient\np[:kAnis] = 11000         # anisotropy constant\np[:N] = 20                # maximum spherical harmonics index to be considered\np[:n] = [1;0;0]           # anisotropy axis\np[:relaxation] = NEEL     # relaxation mode\np[:reltol] = 1e-6         # relative tolerance\np[:abstol] = 1e-6         # absolute tolerance\np[:tWarmup] = 0.00005     # warmup time.

Since this can get quite time intensive it can be benefitial to use parallel computation. To do this you need to start julia with -p P where P is the number of CPU cores that the computer has.\n\nOur goal is to perform simulations with the same 2D excitation but for various different static offset fields. In the magnetic particle imaging (MPI) setting this is usually referred to as the system matrix. In particular we aim to reproduce Fig. 4 of this publication.\n\nWe start by defining the general parameters:\n\nusing MNPDynamics, FFTW\n\n# Parameters\np = Dict{Symbol,Any}()\np[:DCore] = 20e-9         # particle diameter in nm\np[:α] = 0.1               # damping coefficient\np[:kAnis] = 1250          # anisotropy constant\np[:N] = 20                # maximum spherical harmonics index to be considered\np[:relaxation] = NEEL     # relaxation mode\np[:reltol] = 1e-4         # relative tolerance\np[:abstol] = 1e-6         # absolute tolerance\np[:tWarmup] = 0.00005     # warmup time\np[:derivative] = true\np[:solver] = :FBDF        # Use more stable solver\n\n# Excitation frequencies\nconst fx = 2.5e6 / 102\nconst fy = 2.5e6 / 96\n\nsamplingRate = 2.5e6\ntLength = lcm(96,102);             # length of time vector\ntMax = lcm(96,102) / samplingRate; # maximum evaluation time in seconds\nt = range(0, stop=tMax, length=tLength);\n\nNext we define a more general magnetic field function, which not only gets the time t but also the offset.\n\nconst amplitude = 0.012\nB(t, offset) = amplitude*[sin(2*pi*fx*t), sin(2*pi*fy*t), 0] .+ offset \n\nWe then define the offset on a 30 x 30 grid. This can be done in Julia in a very terse syntax using CartesianIndices:\n\nnOffsets = (30, 30, 1)\n\noversampling = 1.25\noffsets = vec([ oversampling*amplitude.*2.0.*((Tuple(x).-0.5)./nOffsets.-0.5)  \n                for x in CartesianIndices(nOffsets) ])\n\nBasically, offsets is a vector of Tuples and the elements are passed to the callback function B we defined before.\n\nIn addition to the offsets we also want the anisotropy axis to be offset dependent (see publication). Therefore, we define the anisotropy axis on a grid as well: \n\nanisotropyAxis = vec([ oversampling*2.0.*((Tuple(x).-0.5)./nOffsets.-0.5) \n                       for x in CartesianIndices(nOffsets) ])\np[:kAnis] = p[:kAnis]*anisotropyAxis\n\nFinally we perform the simulation and apply a Fourier transform along the time axis:\n\nsmM = simulationMNPMultiParams(B, t, offsets; p...)\n\nsmMFT = reshape(rfft(smM, 1), :, 3, nOffsets...)\n\nThe resulting dataset looks like this:\n\n(Image: 2D System Matrix)","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#MNPDynamics","page":"Home","title":"MNPDynamics","text":"Julia package for the simulation of Magnetic Nanoparticle Dynamics","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#Introduction","page":"Home","title":"Introduction","text":"This package provides Julia based implementation of a Fokker-Plank based magnetic particle simulation and allows to model Brownian or Néel rotation.
